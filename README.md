<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The planet is suffering with our current lifestyle, and it is crucial to keep the Earth habitable for future generations. That is why, we would like to change that by building eco-friendly habits in the younger generations. In addition, younger generations are easier to teach than older generations and it is important to teach this habit since childhood. 

According to our expert and based on a research from Brown University, children between the ages of 9 to 12 are the golden age as they are curious towards knowledge and morals. That specific age range are easier to absorb new knowledge and habits. However, parents also play an important role in building and maintaining a long-life habit in their children. The problem is that teaching children eco-friendly lifestyle has its challenges: children only do eco-friendly habits inconsistently, do eco-friendly habits only because of orders from their parents, do eco-friendly habits because they are scared of their parents, and they do not understand why it is needed and why it is important. 

According to the parents that we interviewed, they have previously taught their children about eco-friendly habits. Their children mimics the parents, but they needed to be reminded all time. The children also learn eco-friendly lifestyle in school, specifically from school textbooks and arts-and-crafts.

Sprout is a native iOS Application that helps to build and maintain their childrenâ€™s eco-friendly habit for parents by tracking, reminding, and giving the list that needs to be done with a reward system. This is a solution to the challenge because younger generations are easier to teach than older generations and it is important to teach this habit since childhood.
